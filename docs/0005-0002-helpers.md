name: Helpers

Helper methods are defined in the Pakyow::Helpers module. They can be made accessible to any class by adding an include statement for `Pakyow::Helpers`.

You can extend this module by creating a Pakyow::Helpers module in the 'lib' directory.

	ruby:
	module Pakyow::Helpers
		# your user-created helper methods go here
	end


#### Params

Query string parameters and values from parameterized routes are available in the `params` helper.

	ruby:
	params

(TODO reference working with forms)

#### Sessions & Cookies

Sessions keep state across requests. They can be enabled by using any Rack session middleware:

	ruby:
	middleware do
		use Rack:Session::Cookie
	end

Sessions can then be set and fetched through the `sessions` helper:

	ruby:
	session[:foo] = 'bar'
	pp session[:foo]

	# prints 'bar'

Cookies can be set and fetched the same way:

	ruby:
	cookies[:foo] = 'bar'
	pp cookies[:foo]

	# prints 'bar'

By default, a cookie is created for path '/' and is set to expire in seven days. These defaults can be overridden when setting a cookie:

	ruby:
	cookies[:foo] {
		:value => 'bar',
		:expires => Time.now + 3600,
		:path => '/login'
	}


#### Redirecting

Issuing a browser redirect is easy:

	ruby:
	app.redirect '/foo'

Or even better, if you define your route with a name (such as :foo) you can use URL generation (TODO reference):

	ruby:
	app.redirect router.path(:foo)

When redirecting, the response status is set to 302 by default and the response is sent immediately.

You can overrwite the default status by passing a status code:
	ruby:
	app.redirect '/foo', 301


#### Halting & Transferring Execution

The execution of a route block, a controller, a hook, or a handler can be stopped immediately by calling the `halt` helper:

	ruby:
	app.halt

The execution of a route block, a controller, a hook, or a handler can be stopped immediately and control transferred to another route by using the `reroute` helper:

	ruby:
	app.reroute "/foo"

Or even better, if you define your route with a name (such as :foo) you can use URL generation (TODO reference):

	ruby:
	app.reroute router.path(:foo)

The execution of a route block, a controller, a hook, or a handler can also be stopped immediately and control transferred to a handler (TODO reference handlers).


#### Sending Data

The `send` helper is an easy way to send a file or data in the response:

	ruby:
	app.send(your_file)

You can pass it a file or a path. You can also pass the file name and the mime type (which is guessed if not provided):

	ruby:
	app.send(your_file, 'text/xml', 'xml_data.xml')

It can also send data:

	ruby:
	app.send(your_data, 'text/xml')


#### Request & Response Objects

The underlying Rack Request & Response objects can be accessed through the `request` and `response` methods. This is useful for directly modifying things like response status:

	ruby:
	response.status = 401

In addition, the following things are available in the request:

	ruby:
	request.controller  # the instance of the controller used in this request
	request.action      # the action called in this request
	request.format      # the format used in this request (defaults to HTML)
	request.error       # the error that occurred during the request

The format can be changed by adding an extension to the URL. For example:

	html:
	/foo.json


#### Logging

Write to the log using the static Log class:

	ruby:
	Log.puts 'hello log'

	# prints 'hello log' to the log
