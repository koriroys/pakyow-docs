Pakyow has a built-in route [template](/routing#templates) for defining [RESTful APIs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). Eight actions are supported. Here's an example:

    ruby:
    Pakyow::App.routes do
      restful :post, '/posts' do
        # GET '/posts'
        list do
          # ...
        end

        # GET '/posts/:post_id'
        show do
          # ...
        end

        # GET '/posts/new'
        new do
          # ...
        end

        # POST '/posts'
        create do
          # ...
        end

        # GET '/posts/:post_id/edit'
        edit do
          # ...
        end

        # PATCH '/posts/:post_id'
        update do
          # ...
        end

        # PUT '/posts/:post_id'
        replace do
          # ...
        end

        # DELETE '/posts/:post_id'
        delete do
          # ...
        end
      end
    end

Collection and member routes can also be defined:

    ruby:
    Pakyow::App.routes do
      restful :post '/posts' do
        collection do
        # GET '/posts/some_collection_route'
          get 'some_collection_route' do
            # ...
          end
        end

        member do
          # GET '/posts/:post_id/some_member_route'
          get 'some_member_route' do
            # ...
          end
        end
      end
    end
