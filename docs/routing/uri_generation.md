name: URI Generation
---

Pakyow provides a way to generate full URI strings from a named route and route data. This means the URI is defined once (in the route definition) and can be used throughout the application without duplication. API changes are much less menacing.

Let's start with a simple route:

    ruby:
    get :foo, 'foo' do
      # ...
    end

The URI for the `:foo` route can be generated from the current instance of `Router`:

    ruby:
    router.path :foo
    # => /foo

For routes with arguments, data can be passed to `#path` that is applied to the generated URI:

    ruby:
    get :bar, 'bar/:my_arg' do; end
    router.path :bar, my_arg: '123'
    # => /bar/123

Any object can be passed as data to `#path` that supports key lookup (e.g. `Hash`).

#### Grouped Routes

To generate a URI for a grouped route, simply look up the group before calling `#path`:

    ruby:
    group :foo do
      get(:bar, 'bar') do; end
    end
    router.group(:foo).path :bar
    # => /bar

Routes in nested groups are referenceable by the group they directly belong to.
