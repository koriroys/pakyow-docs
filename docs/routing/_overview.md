Routes are responsible for routing a request to back-end logic. In Pakyow, a route consists of:

  1. HTTP method (GET, PUT, POST, PATCH, DELETE)
  2. Pattern to match request path
  3. Route function(s)
  4. Name (optional)

This is one of the simplest route definitions:

    ruby:
    get '/' do
      p 'got it'
    end

    # sending a GET request to '/' prints 'got it' to the log

Defining routes for the other supported HTTP methods is just as easy:

    ruby:
    put '/' do
      p 'put'
    end

    post '/' do
      p 'post'
    end

    patch '/' do
      p 'patch'
    end    

    delete '/' do
      p 'delete'
    end

Routes should be defined inside an app's `routes` block (in a generated app, this is in `app/lib/routes.rb`).

    ruby:
    Pakyow::App.routes do
      get '/' do
        p 'got it'
      end

      # other routes here
    end

#### Route Arguments

Named arguments can be defined for a route. When the route is matched, data will be parsed from the incoming request and available in the back-end logic through the `params` helper.

    ruby:
    get 'say/:msg' do
      p params[:msg]
    end

    # sending a GET request to '/say/hello' prints 'hello' to the log

#### Named Routes

Routes can be given an optional name.

    ruby:
    get :root, '/' do
      # ...
    end

This name is used to look up and populate routes URIs.

#### Default Route

For convenience, a default route can be defined without providing a path.

    ruby:
    default do
      # ...
    end

This is identical to defining a `get` route for `/` with a name of `:default`.

    ruby:
    get :default, '/' do
      # ...
    end

#### Regex Matchers

In addition to string matchers, regex is also supported.

    ruby:
    # match anything
    get /.*/ do
      # ...
    end

Named captures (available since ruby-1.9) are also supported. When matched, data will be available just like with a route argument.

    ruby:
    get /say\/(?<msg>(.*))/ do
      p params[:msg]
    end

    # sending a GET request to '/say/hello' prints 'hello' to the log
