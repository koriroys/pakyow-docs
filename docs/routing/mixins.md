name: Route Mixins

Once you outgrow a single route set it becomes necessary to share routes and functions between sets. This can be accomplished with route mixins.

Here's a mixin definition:

    ruby:
    module SharedRoutes
      include Pakyow::Routes

      fn :bar
      end
    end

This mixin can now be included into any set, making the `bar` route function available:

    ruby:
    Pakyow::App.routes :my_route_set do
      include SharedRoutes

      get 'foo', before: [:bar] do
      end
    end
