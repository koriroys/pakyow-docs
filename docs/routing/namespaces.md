name: Namespacing Routes

Namespaces make it possible to group routes under a common URI.

    ruby:
    namespace 'foo' do
      default do
        p 'foo: default'
      end

      get 'bar' do
        p 'foo: bar'
      end
    end

    # sending a GET request to '/foo' prints 'foo: default'
    # sending a GET request to '/foo/bar' prints 'foo: bar'
    #
    # sending a GET request to '/' or '/bar' results in a 404

A namespace is implemented as a special kind of [group](/docs/routing#groups), so everything about a group is also true of a namespace. This means that namespaces can be assigned hooks and given a name.

    ruby:
    namespace :foo, 'foo', before: [:some_hook] do
      # foo routes go here
    end
