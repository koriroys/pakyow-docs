name: Grouping Routes

Groups make it possible to organize related routes. A route group can be named and used later when [looking up and creating a route URI](/docs/routing#uri_generation). Names are optional, but routes in an unnamed group cannot be accessed for URI generation.

    ruby:
    group :foo do
      get '/bar' do
        # ...
      end
    end

[Hooks](/docs/routing#hooks) can be applied to a group of routes, making it easier to organize back-end logic. A common need in a web-based application is to protect parts of the application so that only authenticated users have access. Though an easy problem to solve conceptually, it becomes tedius to define and manage the routes if hooks are applied to each route individually. Instead, we can use route groups:

    ruby:
    fn :require_auth do
      redirect '/' unless session[:user]
    end

    group :protected, before: [:require_auth] do
      get '/foo' do
        p 'you found foo'
      end

      get '/bar' do
        p 'you found bar'
      end
    end

    group :unprotected do
      default do
        p 'this route is unprotected'
      end
    end

Looking at the code above we have a much better understanding of what the routes do. It's also easier to add or reorganize routes in the future.
