Route templates make it possible to create a DSL for aspects of your routes. The built-in [RESTful route handling](/routing#restful) in Pakyow is implemented as a template. It's easiest to understand in practice, so here's the built-in RESTful template for your reference:

    ruby:
    template :restful do
      resource_id = ":#{@group}_id"

      nested_path { |path| File.join(path, resource_id) }
      view_path = direct_path.gsub(/:[^\/]+/, '').split('/').reject { |p| p.empty? }.join('/')

      fn :reset_view_path do
        presenter.path = File.join(view_path, 'show') if @presenter
      end

      get :list, '/'
      get :new,  '/new'
      get :show, "/#{resource_id}", before: [:reset_view_path]

      post :create, '/'

      get :edit, "/#{resource_id}/edit"
      patch :update, "/#{resource_id}"
      put :replace, "/#{resource_id}"
      delete :delete, "/#{resource_id}"

      group :collection
      namespace :member, resource_id
    end

This template can then be expanded any number of times in an application's routes:

    ruby:
    Pakyow::App.routes do
      restful :resource_name, '/resource_path' do
        list do
          # ...
        end

        # ...
      end
    end

Templates offer a few wins over the long-hand approach:

  - Routing intricacies are hidden in the template definition, leaving the implementor to focus on the logic.
  - Common patterns can be abstracted, leading to a significant reduction in code duplication.
  - Route changes can be made in one place and be automatically applied to each expansion.

#### Template Hooks

[Hooks](/routing#hooks) can be defined in the template definition or expansion. The difference is that defining a hook in the definition applies the hook to every expansion, while defining a hook on a single expansion applies it to that one expansion. They can be defined at different levels in each case.

For definitions, hooks can be defined on the entire definition or only for a particular route in the definition.

    ruby:
    template :my_template, before: [:foo] do
      get :one, before: [:bar]
      get :two
    end

    my_template do
      one do
        # hooks: foo, bar
      end

      two do
        # hooks: foo
      end
    end

Expansions work in a similar way. Hooks can be defined on the entire expansion or only for a particular route in the definition.

    ruby:
    my_template, before: [:foo] do
      one, before: [bar] do
        # ...
      end

      two do
        # ...
      end
    end
