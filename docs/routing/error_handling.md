name: Error Handling

Handlers are responsible for intercepting an error so that it can be handled properly. They are defined within the routes block.

Here are two basic handler definitions:

    ruby:
    Pakyow::App.routes do
      handler 404 do
        p 'not found'
      end

      handler 500 do
        p 'internal server error'
      end
    end

When invoked, execution is immediately stopped, the response status code is set according to the error, and control is transferred to the handler. A handler can be invoked explicitely by calling it from a route block, hook, or another handler.

    ruby:
    get '/' do
      p 'foo'
      handle 404

      p 'will never see this'
    end

    # a GET request to '/' will print 'foo' and then 'not found' and return with a status of 404

There are two scenarios where a handler wil be invoked implicitly:

  1. If a request doesn't match a route, a view path, or a static file then a 404 handler will be invoked.
  2. If an exception is raised then a 500 handler will be invoked.
