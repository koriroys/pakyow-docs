name: Nested Routes

Groups, namespaces, and template expansions can each be nested at multiple levels. Nesting makes it easier to create and maintain complex route sets, like so:

    ruby:
    namespace :foo, 'foo' do
      default do
        # ...
      end

      namespace :bar, 'bar' do
        default do
          # ...
        end
      end
    end

Two routes are created:

  - GET /foo
  - GET /foo/bar

Adding a group to a namespace is just as easy:

    ruby:
    namespace :foo, 'foo' do
      default do
        # ...
      end

      namespace :bar, 'bar' do
        default do
          # ...
        end
      end

      group before: [:protect] do
        get '/cannot_see_this' do
          # ...
        end
      end
    end

In this case four routes are created:

  - GET /foo
  - GET /foo/bar
  - GET /foo/cannot_see_this

The grouped route inherits the `protect` hook from the group it belongs in. So as expected, hooks are applied at and below the depth they are defined.
