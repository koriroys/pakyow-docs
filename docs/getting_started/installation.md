Pakyow is easy to install, but it relies on Ruby and RubyGems. Make sure those are installed first. Here are some links to point you in the right direction:

  - [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)
  - [RubyGems](http://rubygems.org/pages/download)

Once these are installed, open a terminal prompt and type:

    console:
    gem install pakyow
