name: Sending Data

The `send` helper is an easy way to send a file or data in the response:

    ruby:
    send a_file

You can pass it a file or a path. You can also pass the file name and the mime type (which is guessed if not provided):

    ruby:
    send a_file, 'text/xml', 'xml_data.xml'

It can also send data (a mime type must be provided in this case):

    ruby:
    send some_data, 'text/xml'
