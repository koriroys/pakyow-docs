name: Sessions & Cookies
---

Sessions keep state across requests. They can be enabled by using any Rack session middleware (defined in `app.rb`):

    ruby:
    middleware do |builder|
      builder.use Rack:Session::Cookie
    end

Once configured, sessions can be set and fetched through the `sessions` helper:

    ruby:
    session[:foo] = 'bar'
    
    puts session[:foo]
    # => bar

Cookies can be set and fetched the same way:

    ruby:
    cookies[:foo] = 'bar'

    puts cookies[:foo]
    # => bar

By default, a cookie is created for path '/' and is set to expire in seven days. These defaults can be overridden by using the `Response#set_cookie` method:

    ruby:
    response.set_cookie :foo,
      value: 'bar',
      expires: Time.now + 3600,
      path: '/login'
