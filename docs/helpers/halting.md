name: Halting & Rerouting
---

The execution of a route block, a controller, a hook, or a handler can be stopped immediately by calling the `halt` helper:

    ruby:
    halt

The execution of a route block, a controller, a hook, or a handler can be stopped immediately and control transferred to another route by using the `reroute` helper:

    ruby:
    reroute '/foo'

Or even better, if you define your route with a name (such as :foo) the URI will be generated [automatically](/docs/routing#uri_generation):

    ruby:
    reroute :foo
