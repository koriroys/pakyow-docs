Helper methods are defined in the Pakyow::Helpers module. You can define your own helpers in `app/lib/helpers.rb`:

    ruby:
    module Pakyow::Helpers
      def do_something
        # ...
      end
    end

The helpers are automatically included ino routes and bindings. You can add them to any class by including:

    ruby:
    include Pakyow::Helpers
