- define presentation layer
  - the view
- presentation layer not required
  - if it is, need a presenter
  - define presenter, its roles
- presentation cycle
  - incoming request, construct view, apply logic
  - compare/contrast with other frameworks
- presenter concepts
  - separation of concerns
    - structure: designer; logic: developer
  - structure only means no logic
    - views are declarative
      - how they're composed
      - the data they present
  - separation means structural view is never destructed
    - rollback to prototype mode at any point (TODO reference tip/trick)
- view driven development
