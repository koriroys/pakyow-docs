name: Parsers

Parsers allow views to be processed prior to being handed to Presenter. The most common use for view parsers is to allow views to be written in languages other than HTML (e.g. Markdown or HAML). Since Presenter always expects HTML, a parser is passed the contents of the view and should always return HTML. Below is an example that uses RDiscount to process views written in Markdown:

    ruby:
    parser(:md, :markdown) { |content|
      RDiscount.new(content).to_html
    }

This parser will handle any view with a `md` or `markdown` extension. An application using this parser can define views in both Markdown and HTML. Presenter works as if all views were written in HTML.

    views/
      main.md
      pakyow.html

Parsers are defined in an application's `presenter` block (TODO reference architecture).
