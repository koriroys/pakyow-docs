In an effort to keep final editing to a minimum, here are some guidelines to follow when writing content:

  - Be clear but not elementary. A beginner should be able to read the docs and understand how to use Pakyow, but the concepts should be described for what they are and in terms a seasoned developer can relate to.
  - Include examples as necessary (look at an existing file for a formatting example). If the example produces meaningful output, include the output as a code comment at the end of the example.
  - Add references to related concepts as applicable. This includes references to other Pakyow docs as well as core Ruby or general programming concepts. When making a reference be sure to include some details on how the reference relates to the current topic.
  - If content for a particular topic needs to be broken up, do so with level four headings. See Routing Overview for an example.
  - Keep the narrative consistent. Refer to the reader the-second person and Pakyow (framework or team) in third-person.
  - When referencing a symbol (e.g. class, method) wrap in tildes so it is formatted as `code`. If a particular class/method is being referenced format as `ClassName#method_name`. If the context is implied (e.g. the method for defining a GET route), do not include the class name.
